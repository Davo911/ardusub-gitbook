# Tether

A suitable tether is required for operation. Sorry, your RC radio and WiFi connection will not penetrate water. In some cases, additional electronics are required at the ends of the tether to achieve reliable communications.

Radio waves donâ€™t travel far through water and acoustic modems have limited bandwidth, so a tether is a critical component to connect the vehicle to a surface computer.
