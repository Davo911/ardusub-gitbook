# Tether

A tether is a length of cable which connects the [Companion Computer]() to the [Topside Computer](). Radio frequency (RF) waves donâ€™t travel far through water and acoustic modems have limited bandwidth, so a tether is a critical component to connect the vehicle to a surface computer.

# Requirments

The Companion Computer communicates by 10/100 Base Ethernet. Therefore, a standard [Cat 5 cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable) may be used to connect to the vehicle and topside computer. The maximum transmission length of Cat5 cable is around 100m.
