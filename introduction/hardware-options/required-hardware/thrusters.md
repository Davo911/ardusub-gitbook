# Thrusters

Thrusters are necessary to maneuver an underwater vehicle around. The number and orientation of thrusters on a vehicle determines the number of degrees of freedom (DoF) a vehicle may maneuver in.

The maximum current draw of the power supply on the vehicle is an  important consideration when choosing what type and how many thrusters to mount on a vehicle. The maximum current draw at the intended voltage should be totaled up for all the thrusters. If this exceeds the current rating of the power supply, either lower the supply voltage or remove thrusters.

Although brushless or brushed thrusters may be used with ArduSub, they may not be mixed, and the thruster type needs to be paired to an appropriate [Electronic Speed Control (ESC)(/introduction/hardware-options/required-hardware/escs.md).

Brushless thrusters are a good choice for propulsion as they often have a
