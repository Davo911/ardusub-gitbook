# Sonars

# Altimeters and Echosounders

Another useful type of sonar is an echosounder, also known as an altimeter when installed on an ROV. An altimeter is a single-beam sonar which gets a range measurement from the bottom of the ROV to the seabed. This is useful in low visibility situations where the distance to the bottom is unknown.

In addition to getting a distance reading, echosounders can provide the full echo response (echo strength versus time) which can be plotted like the display of a fishfinder sonar, which is useful for locating targets or obstructions beneath the ROV.

# Scanning Imaging Sonars

One of the most useful types of sonars on an ROV is what is known as a mechanically scanning sonar. Scanning sonars are useful tools for navigation, and acoustically imaging targets in a top-down 2-dimensional representation. If you are new to scanning sonars, we have written a guide, which illustrates the key concepts and can help with image recognition: [Understanding and Using Scanning Sonars](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/understanding-and-using-scanning-sonars/).
